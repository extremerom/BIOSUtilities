# HP BIOS Recovery USB Drive

This USB drive contains the necessary files for HP laptop BIOS recovery.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Folder Structure

HP BIOS recovery requires files to be in a SPECIFIC folder structure:

```
USB Drive (Root)
└── Hewlett-Packard/
    └── BIOS/
        └── Current/
            ├── BIOS_00.bin
            ├── BIOS_00.sig
            ├── BIOS_01.bin
            ├── BIOS_01.sig
            ├── BIOS_02.bin
            └── BIOS_02.sig
```

⚠️ **DO NOT CHANGE** this folder structure! The HP BIOS recovery process specifically looks for files in the `Hewlett-Packard/BIOS/Current/` directory.

## Contents

- **Hewlett-Packard/BIOS/Current/**: Official HP BIOS recovery folder
  - Contains all BIOS binary files (*.bin) and signature files (*.sig)
- **EFI/BOOT/**: UEFI boot structure
  - BOOTx64.efi - Standard UEFI bootloader
  - HpBiosUpdate*.efi - HP BIOS update tools
- **EFI/HP/BIOS/New/**: Alternative HP EFI location
- **HP/**: HP utilities and EFI files
- **EFI_Tools/**: Key EFI recovery tools  
- **BIOS_Backup/**: Backup copy of all extracted BIOS files

## How to Use

### Preparation
1. Format a USB drive as FAT32 (recommended: 8GB or larger)
2. Copy ALL contents of this folder to the root of the USB drive
3. Verify that the folder structure is: `[USB Drive]/Hewlett-Packard/BIOS/Current/`
4. Safely eject the USB drive

### BIOS Recovery Process
1. **Turn off** the HP laptop completely
2. **Insert** the prepared USB drive into the laptop
3. **Press and hold** Win+B (or Fn+B on some models) keys
4. While holding the keys, **press the Power button**
5. Keep holding Win+B (or Fn+B) for about 10-15 seconds
6. The laptop should detect the USB and start the recovery process
7. **Wait** for the process to complete (may take several minutes)
8. The laptop will restart automatically when done

### Important Notes

⚠️ **WARNING**: 
- Do NOT interrupt the BIOS recovery process
- Keep the laptop connected to AC power during recovery
- Do NOT remove the USB drive until the process is complete
- The laptop may restart multiple times - this is normal
- DO NOT modify the Hewlett-Packard/BIOS/Current/ folder structure

ℹ️ **Compatibility**:
- This recovery structure is designed for HP laptops
- Different HP models may have different key combinations
- Some models use Win+V instead of Win+B
- Consult your laptop's documentation for specific recovery instructions

ℹ️ **Alternative Recovery Methods**:
- If Win+B doesn't work, try Win+V
- Some HP models require Fn+Esc, then Fn+B
- Check HP support website for model-specific recovery instructions
